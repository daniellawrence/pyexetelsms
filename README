This connects to the remote exetel server and submits the SMS via https

Example
------------
 #!/usr/bin/python
 from exetelsms import Exetel, SMS

 # Define username & password
 USER = "YOUR_USERNAME"		# username at exetel sms gateway
 PASSWORD = "YOUR_PASSWORD"	# password for above username

 # connect to the gateway and get the current credit
 print "Checking Credit of %s" % USER
 sms_gateway = Exetel(USER, PASSWORD)
 sms_gateway.get_credit()
 print "%s has $%d in credit" % ( sms_gateway.username, sms_gateway.credit )

 # construct an sms
 SENDER = "Sender of the SMS" 	     # up to 11 chars
 MOBILE = "0000000000" 		     # Australian phone number
 MESSAGE = "Test sms from python API" # Message that will be sent
 print "creating new sms"
 sms = SMS(sms_gateway,SENDER,MOBILE,MESSAGE)

 # Print the sms
 print sms

 # send the sms on its way...
 print "Sending sms"
 sms.send()
 
 # print the new status
